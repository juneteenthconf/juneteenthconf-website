                        <p>
                            Juneteenth Conference celebrates and highlights Black professionals in the tech
                            industry. Our mission is to create a space where Black technologists can come
                            together, connect, learn, and grow in their careers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The journey of Juneteenth Conference started in 2020, when our initial conference
                            was held virtually in the aftermath of the murder of George Floyd and during the
                            pandemic. Despite the challenges of the moment, we planned, organized, and
                            launched the conference in two weeks, featuring two days of sessions with all Black
                            speakers and thousands of attendees.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Since then, Juneteenth Conference has grown into a highly anticipated event in the
                            tech industry, attracting attendees from all over the world. We provide a platform
                            for Black technologists to showcase their work, connect with their peers, and learn
                            from leaders in the field.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For 2023, Juneteenth Conference will be held in-person for the first time, hosted
                            in Chicago on June 15th and 16th, the Thursday and Friday before Juneteenth. This
                            milestone event will provide attendees with a unique opportunity to connect,
                            network, and learn in person.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We are committed to creating a diverse, inclusive, and welcoming space for Black
                            technologists and we believe that Juneteenth Conference has the potential to make a
                            positive and lasting impact on the tech industry. We are grateful for the support
                            of our attendees, sponsors, and partners, and look forward to growing and evolving
                            Juneteenth Conference in the years to come.

            <h2>Our Pledge</h2>
            <p>
              In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as organizers pledge to making

              age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of
              experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual
              identity and orientation.
            </p>
            <p>
              We adhere to the Contributor Covenant. The full text can be found here.

              <li>Gracefully accepting constructive criticism</li>

              <li>Showing empathy towards other community members</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:<br />
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances</li>

              <li>Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Our Responsibilities</h2>
            <p>
              The conference organizers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are
              expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable
              behavior.
            </p>
            <p>
              The CoC team has the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki
              edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily
              or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
              or
              harmful.
            </p>
            <h2>Scope</h2>
            <p>
              This Code of Conduct applies both within event spaces on the conference and in public spaces when an
              individual is representing the conference or its community. Examples of representing the event or
              community
              include using an official conference e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or
              acting
              as an appointed representative at the online or offline event.
            </p>
            <h2>Enforcement</h2>
            <p>
              Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting
              florien.drees@microsoft.com (she/her) or henk.boelman@microsoft.com (he/him). All complaints will be
              reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the
              circumstances. The CoC team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an
              incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.
            </p>
            <p>
              CoC team members who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or
              permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the CoC team.
            </p>

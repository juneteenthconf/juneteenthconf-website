              <h2>The Cause</h2>
              <p>
                The mission of Juneteenth Conference is to create a space to celebrate Black
		professionals in Technology. We all know too well how the refrain from tech
		companies regarding underrepresentation of Black people is that "it's a pipeline
		issue." Extending from that mission, we are addressing the pipeline issue head on
		with our Black Tech High School Internship Program. Your ticket is fully
		deductible as a 501c3 Charitable Contribution and will help us reach our goal of
		providing Black high school students with paid internships to prepare for tech careers.  
	      </p>
	      <h2>The Experience</h2>
              <p>
                Juneteenth Conference 2023 will be the first time we've gathered in person. We're
		hosting a event with a wonderful roster of speakers. Your in person ticket gets
		you access to the event in downtown Chicago. Breakfast and lunch will be provided
		both days.

              <h2>About The Conference</h2>
              <p>
                Juneteenth Conference celebrates and highlights Black professionals in the tech industry. Our mission is to create
                a space where Black technologists can come together, connect, learn, and grow in their careers.
              </p>
              <p>
                The journey of Juneteenth Conference started in 2020, when our initial conference was held virtually in the
                aftermath of the murder of George Floyd and during the pandemic. Despite the challenges of the moment, we planned,
                organized, and launched the conference in two weeks, featuring two days of sessions with all Black speakers and
                thousands of attendees.
              </p>
              <p>
                Since then, Juneteenth Conference has grown into a highly anticipated event in the tech industry, attracting
                attendees from all over the world. We provide a platform for Black technologists to showcase their work, connect
                with their peers, and learn from leaders in the field.
              </p>
              <p>
                For 2023, Juneteenth Conference will be held in-person for the first time, hosted in Chicago on June 15th and
                16th, the Thursday and Friday before Juneteenth. This milestone event will provide attendees with a unique
                opportunity to connect, network, and learn in person.
              </p>
              <p>
                We are committed to creating a diverse, inclusive, and welcoming space for Black technologists and we believe that
                Juneteenth Conference has the potential to make a positive and lasting impact on the tech industry. We are
                grateful for the support of our attendees, sponsors, and partners, and look forward to growing and evolving
                Juneteenth Conference in the years to come.
              </p>
              Join us in Chicago for Juneteenth Conference 2023, and be a part of this important and impactful event.

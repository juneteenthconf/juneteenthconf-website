              <strong>The Mission of JuneteenthConf is to provide a judgement free space for underrepresented people in
                tech to learn 
                and grow and to amplify their voices. To be a counterbalance to the biases, implicit or otherwise, that
                hold our
                industry and our society back.</strong>
